Game Rules
1. Deck is shuffled.
2. User clicks Submit to deal cards.
3. The cards are analysed for game winning conditions, e.g. Blackjack.
4. The cards are displayed to the user.
5. The user decides whether to hit or stand, using the submit button to submit their choice.
6. The user's cards are analysed for winning or losing conditions.
7. The computer decides to hit or stand automatically based on game rules.
8. The game either ends or continues.

Specific Blackjack Rules
1. Dealer must hit if total is under 17

Betting Rules
1. $100 for each player to buy in
2. $10 for each player to play a hand
3. Winning a game will give the player => $10 + $10 = $20
4. Winning a game with a Blackjack will get the player 1.5x => $10 + $15 = $25
5. A push (tie) between player and dealer will give the player their $10 back
6. Players can owe money to the casino, which is why their wallet can go negative

Multiplayer Rules
1. There can be up to 7 players playing in the same game

TODO:
1. Option to have the players stop playing / do another buy in if wallet goes to $0
2. Option to have players set their own amout of bets, instead of fixed
3. Other functionalities such as Doubling bets, Splitting
4. Unit tests
5. Improve look and feel with colors, images, and possibly animations
