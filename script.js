// There will be only two players. One human and one computer (for the Base solution).
// The computer will always be the dealer.
// Each player gets dealt two cards to start. For each player, both cards are dealt face up. For the dealer, one card is face down.
// If a player has a total of 21, they automatically win 1.5 times their bet from the dealer and they are done.
// The player goes first, and decides if they want to hit (draw a card) or stand (end their turn).
// The dealer has to hit if their hand is below 17. If it's 17 or higher they have to stay. If dealer busts, every player in that round win 1x their bet.
// Each players' score is the total of their card ranks. Jacks/Queen/Kings are 10. Aces can be 1 or 11.
// The player who is closer to, but not above 21 wins the hand.
