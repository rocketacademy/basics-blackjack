// The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
//Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.
//Each player starts with two cards.
//To 'Hit' is to ask for another card.
//To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.
//If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
//If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack.
//Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher.
