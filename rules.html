    <h2>Welcome to Blackjack!</h2>
    <div id="container">
      The version implemented here is one-deck casino blackjack. Since there are
      so many rule variations out there, the detailed rules are spelled out
      here.
      <br />
      To start, input the number of players. Each player starts with 100 chips.
      Use the slider to place your bets and click New Hand to deal. The bet has
      to be an integer amount. If a player has less than 1 chip, he will be
      topped up with 100 chips. A player's chip count and win/loss are tracked.
      <br /><br />
      In Blackjack, the objective is to win by creating card totals higher than
      those of the dealer's hand but not exceeding 21, or by stopping at a total
      in the hope that dealer will bust. Number cards count as their number, the
      jack, queen, and king ("face cards" or "pictures") count as 10, and aces
      count as either 1 or 11 according to the player's choice. A total of 21 on
      the first two cards is a "natural" or "blackjack."
      <br />
      The players and dealer will be dealt two cards. All players will receive
      their hands face-up. The dealer will receive the first card face up and
      the second card face down. The dealer peeks at the second card if the
      first card is an ace or ten-value card but only reveals it if it makes the
      dealer's hand a blackjack.
      <br /><br />
      If the dealer has blackjack:
      <br />
      All players with blackjack tie with the dealer and their bets are returned
      to them. All players without blackjack lose their bets. The hand is over,
      and players can place their bets again for the new hand. If the dealer
      doesn't have blackjack:
      <br />
      All players with blackjack win and receive a payout at 3:2 odds, or 1.5
      times their bet. All players without blackjack will take turns, starting
      from the player first dealt. On each turn, the options available are:
      <br />
      Hit. The player will receive a card from the top of the deck. Stand. The
      player ends their turn and play continues with the next player. Split.
      This option is only available when the player's hand has two cards and if
      the starting two cards have the same rank. The two cards will be separated
      into two hands and one card each will be dealt to them. Play proceeds as
      normal. Further rules on splitting below. Double down. The player doubles
      their bet, and receives a single card. This option is only available when
      the player's hand has two cards. Surrender. The player gives up half their
      bet and forfeits their hand. This option is only available when the
      player's hand has two cards.
      <br />
      If a player busts upon hitting or doubling, the player loses his bet. Once
      all players have finished their turn, the dealer reveals his face down
      card. If there are still remaining players, the dealer draws cards if
      needed until the hand achieves a total of 17 or higher. The dealer never
      doubles, splits, or surrenders. If the dealer busts, all remaining player
      hands win. If the dealer does not bust, each remaining bet wins if its
      hand is higher than the dealer's, loses if it is lower, and ties if it is
      the same. The hand is over, and players can place their bets again for the
      new hand. Rules on splitting:
      <br />
      Re-splitting not allowed. Hitting split aces allowed. A ten-value card
      dealt on a split ace (or vice versa) will not be counted as a blackjack,
      but simply as 21 points. Double down and surrender after split allowed.
