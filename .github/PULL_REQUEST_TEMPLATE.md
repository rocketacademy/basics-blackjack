Please fill in one error and/or error message you received while working on this assignment.
Deciding on the value of ace in different scenarios

What part of the assignment did you spend the most time on?
Converting the value of aces to fit all scenarios - e.g. Assuming player or computer has a King and 4 Aces, it should be 14, and not bust. But my original code kept one of the aces value at 11, and I had to find a new way to convert the value of aces.

Comfort Level (1-5):
With 1 least comfortable and 5 being most comfortable, this was a 2.

Completeness Level (1-5):
4

What did you think of this deliverable?
It was good

Is there anything in this code that you feel pleased about?
Being able to find a way to convert the value of Ace

What's one aspect of your code you would like specific, elaborate feedback on?
How come it's so difficult to get a blackjack with my code? The generate deck function and shuffle cards function seem to work fine but it takes almost 100+ tries to even get a blackjack.
